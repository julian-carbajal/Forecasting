Create a multi-scenario capital expenditure model for a hypothetical renewable energy project. Build it to forecast costs across different timelines (3, 5, 10 years) with variables for equipment costs, labor, permitting delays, and interest rates. Include sensitivity analysis showing how changing key assumptions affects total project cost. This mirrors the scenario-based spending models you'd maintain at SCE.
Build a monthly operational expense forecasting model for a utility department. Use historical data patterns to project costs for maintenance, labor, materials, and overhead across different seasons. Include variance analysis comparing actuals to forecasts - exactly what you'd do reporting on operational expenses.
Data Analysis & Visualization Projects
Download public utility financial data from FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) filings. Analyze spending patterns across different utility companies, focusing on transmission and distribution investments. Create PowerBI dashboards showing trends in capital spending, cost per customer, and operational efficiency metrics. This builds both your data analysis skills and utility industry knowledge.
Create a project tracking dashboard that mimics what you'd use for infrastructure projects. Include timelines, budget vs. actual spending, milestone completion rates, and risk indicators. Build automated alerts for projects that are over budget or behind schedule.
Industry-Specific Knowledge Building
Research and model the economics of different clean energy technologies (solar, wind, battery storage). Calculate levelized cost of energy (LCOE) for each technology under different scenarios. This helps you understand the financial drivers behind SCE's clean energy investments.
Study California's regulatory environment - particularly the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) rate-setting process. Create a simple model showing how utility investments get recovered through customer rates. This context is crucial for understanding how your financial work connects to regulatory compliance.
SAP & System Skills
While you can't access SCE's SAP system, you can practice with SAP's free trial versions or take online SAP courses focusing on finance modules (SAP FICO). Learn the terminology around work orders, cost centers, and project accounting that utilities commonly use.
Practice advanced Excel skills specific to financial analysis: dynamic arrays, power query for data connections, scenario manager, and financial functions. Build templates that could handle the complex multi-year, multi-scenario modeling typical in utility planning.
Cross-Functional Project Coordination
Volunteer to coordinate a financial analysis project at your current job or through a professional organization. Practice facilitating meetings, tracking deliverables, and presenting financial findings to non-finance stakeholders. Document your process improvement suggestions - this directly matches the role's emphasis on process refinement.
Start with the forecasting model project - it's most directly applicable and will give you concrete examples to discuss in interviews. Then layer in the industry knowledge and visualization skills. These projects will give you specific examples of relevant work and demonstrate your genuine interest in the utility sector's transformation.
